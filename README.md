In order to have a running version of this project you must setup your machine with:

- Git
- Scala 2.12.4

```bash
git clone git@github.com:socialsoftware/saslearning.git
```

### Configuration

### Testing

After having your machine ready to go, all you need to do to run tests is:

```
sbt test
```

### Running

After having your machine setup and your configuration defined all you have to is:

```
$ sbt reStart

We use [sbt-revolver](https://github.com/spray/sbt-revolver) for starting/stopping
and triggered restart. Please see its documentation for other usage options.
Traditional `sbt run` also works.
